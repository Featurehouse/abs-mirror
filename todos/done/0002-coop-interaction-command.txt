Title: Coop interaction command

The "text buttons" would lead the command executor to execute an internal command (like /internalitemspeedrun).
This command has human-readable parameter name. However, if the command executor isn't
 running an INTERACTION SESSION, then it will raise an error to the executor which looks like:
		This command is unsupported. Do you mean '/xxx xxx'?
The message above must be localized.

Edit [Mon 28 Nov 2022 12:30]: interaction might be replaced with draft.
