Title: PVP Records

Completely same with the ordinary ones, expect for a field showing that someone shares
  the same session with one another.
Example:
    "pvp_session": "8281f7cb-6694-4972-acfc-f480baca256a"
Players with the same nonnull session can view each other's running process
  (if they have the permission `viewPvpMates`)
Close reason: implemented with `trust` engine. If it doesn't work, it might be replaced with this.
