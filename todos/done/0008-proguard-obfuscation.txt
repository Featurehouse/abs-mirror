Title: Proguard Obfuscation

Date: Fri 20 Jan 2023 11:15

@ApiStatus.Internal things should be obfuscated:
- classes with @Internal should be obfuscated
- methods/fields with @Internal should be obfuscated

How to process:
- pre-process before `proguardJar`, using ASM core api
- if non-class or class is @Internal, skip the class
- if class is non-@Internal, mark as @abs.generated.NonInternal
- if method/field is public/protected AND non-@Internal, mark as @abs.generated.NonInternal (RuntimeInvisible)
- in proguard: ```
	keepnames '@abs.generated.NonInternal public class *'
	keepclassmembernames 'public class * { @abs.generated.NonInternal *; }'
```
