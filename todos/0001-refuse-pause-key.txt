Title: Describe why I DON'T WANT TO write a GLFW key to pause a running record.

Date: Wed 19 Oct 2022 13:30

Because:
 - in singleplayer: player can pause the game in order to pause the record immediately.
 - in server: if the server admins have turned the config "timerPausesWhenVacant" on,
   you can disconnect the server to pause your record. You should manually resume it
   by typing "/itemspeedrun resume" after rejoining.
